## Overview

The purpose of this project is to learn how to collaborate with others and experience working in a team. This first build week is meant to put everything that we learned within the first four weeks into practice.

We were put into teams and our team consisted of two web UI developers, one front-end engineer, one back-end engineer, and one team leader. As the two web UI developers, we worked together to build a marketing page and an about page for the web application that the front-end and back-end engineers will build.

For this particular project, we are using LESS as a CSS proprocessor. We are also using FontAwesome and Animate.css for external libraries.
